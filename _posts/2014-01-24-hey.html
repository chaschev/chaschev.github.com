        <h2>Hey</h2>
        <p>My blog on programming will be here. I will post about Java, my open source project <a href="" target="_blank">Bear</a> and anything I find interesting.</p>

        <p>I forked this blog from <a href="https://github.com/Ocramius/ocramius.github.com">ocramius.github.com</a> so if you like it, you could use customize Jekyll, the engine which is based on, or you can save time and do the same fork as I did.</p>
